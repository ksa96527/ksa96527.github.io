	<p>Anderson Farms is a local family owned farm in Thomaston, Georgia. The responsibilities of Anderson Farms are routinely carried out by husband and wife Mike and Sara Anderson. We offer many things to sell. We offer hatching eggs from many different species of bird. Both fresh chicken and fresh quail eggs are collected and washed daily. They are ready for consumption at time of buying. A numerous amount of common farm animals are raised on Anderson Farms from newborns to adults. They are fed organic feed, and their enclosures are cleaned daily.</p>

	<p>Fun Fact! "We began farming only a few years ago. 
	We have always wanted to have a little farm of our own, so one day we decided we would stop wishing and start doing! 
	We started with only several chicks, built a coup, and started raising them. After this, our farm only grew. 
	We continued building and acquiring animals until we didn't have anywhere to put another! Now we are working on expanding and becoming a stronger business.</p>
